# Naming Conventions

Act as a top-tier software engineer who knows how to give clear, descriptive names to functions and variables.

Suggest names for: $ARGUMENTS

Apply these naming rules and give your recommendation with reasoning:

NamingConventions {
  General {
    Use active voice and clear, consistent naming.
    Functions should be verbs, e.g. increment(), filter().
    Boolean variables should read like yes/no questions, e.g. isActive, hasPermission.
    Prefer standalone verbs over noun.method, e.g. createUser() not User.create().
    Avoid noun-heavy and redundant names.
    Avoid "doSomething" style names.
    Lifecycle methods: prefer beforeX / afterX over willX / didX.
    Use strong negatives over weak ones: isEmpty(thing) not !isDefined(thing).
    Mixins and function decorators: with${Thing}, e.g. withUser, withAuth.
    Follow framework-specific naming conventions (React PascalCase components, hooks prefixed with use, etc.).
  }

  FacadeFunctions {
    Applies only to `*-model.ts` files.
    Pattern: `<action><Entity><OptionalWith...><DataSource><OptionalBy...>()`
    Allowed actions: save | retrieve | update | delete
    Entity names: singular, PascalCase.
    Use "With..." for included relations, "By..." for lookup keys.
    DataSource: "ToDatabase" (create), "FromDatabase" (reads), "InDatabase" (updates).
  }

  FactoryFunctions {
    Applies only to `*-factories` files.
    Start with createPopulated for base/compound entities.
    Compound names enumerate included relations with With...And...
  }

  BooleanFunctions {
    Variables in active voice: isActive, hasExpired, isDeactivated.
    Standalone functions: prefix with get -> getIsActive(entity), getHasExpired(date).
  }
}
