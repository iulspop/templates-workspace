# React Router

Act as a senior React Router engineer reviewing code for correctness, performance, and best practices.

Review: $ARGUMENTS

ReactRouter {
  Loaders {
    Fetch all data in loaders, never in components with `useEffect`. Loaders run before render and eliminate loading spinners.
    Use `Promise.all` for independent data fetches within a loader to avoid sequential waterfalls.
    Use request-scoped caching (via context) so multiple loaders can call the same data function without duplicate requests.
    Control revalidation with `shouldRevalidate` to skip unnecessary refetches. Use `useRevalidator` for polling/focus patterns.
    Type loaders with `Route.LoaderArgs` and consume with `useLoaderData<typeof loader>()`.
    Validate URL params early with zod or invariant — don't trust `params` to be well-formed.
    Pass `request.signal` to fetch calls and database queries so they abort when the user navigates away.
    Colocate data queries in `queries.server.ts` next to the route file.
  }

  Actions {
    Validate all form data with zod schemas. Return validation errors with `data({ errors }, { status: 400 })` — don't throw for validation failures.
    Use `throw redirect("/path")` after successful mutations to prevent resubmission (Post/Redirect/Get).
    Use zod `.transform()` for input sanitization (trim, lowercase, parse numbers) during validation.
    Use `z.discriminatedUnion("intent", [...])` to handle multiple actions in one route with type-safe intent matching.
    Use `clientAction` for instant client-side validation before hitting the server.
    Re-throw redirects and unknown errors in catch blocks — only catch expected error types.
  }

  Forms {
    Use `useFetcher` for in-place mutations (likes, toggles, inline edits) that shouldn't trigger navigation. Use `<Form>` when the mutation should navigate.
    Show pending state with `fetcher.state !== "idle"` or `useNavigation().state`. Use `useSpinDelay` to avoid flicker.
    Reset uncontrolled forms on success with `formRef.current?.reset()` in an effect.
    Return field values from actions on validation error so inputs repopulate with `defaultValue={actionData?.fields?.email}`.
    Add `<HoneypotInputs />` to public-facing forms for bot protection.
  }

  Routing {
    Organize routes as folders with colocated `queries.server.ts`, `actions.server.ts`, `route.tsx`, and `components/`.
    Use resource routes (no default export) for API-like endpoints. Name them `api.<resource>.tsx`.
    Use dedicated action routes (`actions.<noun>-<verb>.ts`) for reusable mutations consumed by multiple pages via `useFetcher`.
    Name the default export `Component` in all route files.
    Never import from other route files — import shared modules instead. Exception: import `type { action }` for `useFetcher` type inference.
    Access parent route data with `useRouteLoaderData` in UI. In loaders, re-fetch (request-scoped caching prevents duplicate calls).
  }

  Middleware {
    Authenticate in middleware, authorize in each loader/action. Keep auth checks close to data access.
    Store session in middleware so loaders/actions get a single instance per request.
    Use `AsyncLocalStorage` for request-scoped context accessible without passing args through every function.
    Add `Server-Timing` headers in middleware for performance observability.
    Generate a request ID in middleware for log correlation across the request lifecycle.
  }

  Security {
    Protect mutations with CSRF tokens or verify `Sec-Fetch-Site` headers to reject cross-site requests.
    Sanitize user-driven redirect URLs with `safeRedirect(redirectTo, "/")` — never redirect to arbitrary user input.
    Apply CORS headers only to API resource routes that need cross-origin access. Use specific origins, not wildcards.
    Validate cookie payloads with schemas using typed cookies.
    Use `prefetch="intent"` on `<Link>` for faster navigation — preloads data on hover/focus.
  }

  ErrorHandling {
    Export `ErrorBoundary` from every route with data fetching. Use `isRouteErrorResponse` to distinguish HTTP errors from unexpected exceptions.
    In layout routes, make `ErrorBoundary` layout-aware so errors render within the app shell.
    Use `<Suspense>` with `<Await resolve={promise}>` for streamed loader data — return promises from `data()` and they auto-stream.
  }
}
