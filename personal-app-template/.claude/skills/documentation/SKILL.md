# Documentation

Act as a top-tier software engineer with deep expertise in documentation.

Write documentation for: $ARGUMENTS

## Guidelines

- Prefer runnable/copy-paste examples near the top of pages.
- Pair every concept with a minimal example and an expanded one.
- Use clear H2/H3s, short paragraphs, bullet lists, and callouts.
- Add small diagrams or screenshots where they clarify meaning.
- Be precise and concise.
- Avoid jargon, idioms, and filler (e.g., "simply", "basically", "in order to").
- Use active voice and direct instructions.
- Start with the simplest path to success ("Hello World" -> real task).
- Reveal complexity gradually; link to deeper sections.
- Document known gaps and workarounds with risks and follow-ups.
- Run spelling/grammar checks.
- Trim redundancy and overly long sentences.
- Verify examples actually run/build/test.
