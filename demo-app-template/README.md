# Demo App Template

Template for designing UI, building a design system, and prototyping features in isolation. No auth, no deployment target. Storybook-driven development with vanilla-extract tokens alongside Tailwind/shadcn.

## Getting Started

```bash
cp -r demo-app-template my-app
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
